# Genre Classification for Audio Files

Welcome to our project! We are aiming to classify audio files by genre. 

This repository contains a collection of scripts, which are used to download audio files of different genres, generate low-level features from these audio files, compare the performance of different algorithms, and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It also includes a script to generate graphs for the report.

The processed and trimmed audio files can be accessed from the following [link](https://tcdud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/bahuguns_tcd_ie/EjekotFSnGVEjQCr3f8XxRoBSPmZsZdER6YvZuDfkkfSrQ?e=YXcdh2)

## Repository Structure

- `Generating_low_level_features`: This script contains the code to download audio files of different genres.
- `experiments`: This script is used to compare the performance of different algorithms.
- `create_data`: Performs operations on audio files to create low-level features, which are later used to train the model.
- `training_main_model`: This is the main CNN model used for genre classification.
- `generate_graphs_librosa`: A script to generate graphs for the report.

We invite you to explore the code and the resulting genre classifications. We welcome any questions or feedback!
